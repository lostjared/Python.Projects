# File Data Processor

## Overview
This Python script reads text data from files and displays the data in a formatted hexadecimal representation. It is designed to be used as a command-line tool to process multiple files.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
No additional installation is required, as the script uses Python's standard libraries. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Usage
To use this script, you can pass one or more filenames as arguments. The script will read each file and output the contents in a hexadecimal format.

### Command Line Syntax
```bash
python bin2py.py [file1] [file2] ...
```

If no filenames are provided, the script will attempt to read from standard input (stdin).

### Example
```bash
python bin2py.py example.txt
```

This will process the file `example.txt` and display its content as hexadecimal values.

## Functionality
- **Reading Files**: The script reads the contents of each specified file.
- **Processing Data**: Converts the text data from the files into a formatted string of hexadecimal values.
- **Error Handling**: If a file cannot be read, it will notify the user.
